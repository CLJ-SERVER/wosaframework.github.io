## What is Wosa?
World Of San Andreas commonly known as Wosa is a FiveM based framework aimed to provide the best roleplay experience available on the market. The framework has a native GTA feeling to it that makes is unique compared to other popular alternatives such as ESX or vRP. One other important aspect of the framework was to require as little dependencies as possible and only come with a few required resources for running the framework. In comparison with ESX where you see servers that have 100+ scripts to run how they want we only have 4 that comes with everything you need.
