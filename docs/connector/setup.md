# API Connector
The connector are used to access data from other resources than the *wosa_core*. An example of were the connector is used are the *wosa_jobs* which is the resource for all of the jobs.

## Setup
A few files is required to be put in your resource to use the connector. We use two different connector files, One for the server and one for your client. It is super easy to set up, Let us go through the steps!

1. **Download the latest connector files from [here](https://github.com/WosaFramework/Wosa-Connector/releases).**
2. **Drag & drop the files provided with the download to your resource.**
3. **Add the files to your __resource***(outdated dont use this)*** or fxmanifest file.**

## Usage
Find [client](natives_client.md) and [server](natives_server.md) functions documented at the next page. Keep in mind that FiveM natives and Wosa natives are not the same thing.
