Don't worry we will cover you with the basic and most important things. Spawning in Alright, So you have finished your character and is now standing at the airport wondering what to do. We recommend you to do the following... Check out your main menu, Press M (defult) to open it as you will spend ALOT of your time in here. Rent a taxi or a bicycle at the airport to get yourself into the town of Los Santos. When in the city, head to a store and purchase something to eat and drink as without health you won't get far. Now it is time to get into business, as from the beginning with no levels not all interactions are unlocked. We have a made a list for good starter jobs below were you can get some starter cash and levels from which requires no or little levels to play. Starter jobs Looking for great jobs without any or very little level required ? Take a look at our list we made for you! BurgerShot job , serve real players hamburgers and make them yourself! [0 points required] Public Works , do work for the state around the map. [0 points required] Construction Works , work on construction sites around Los Santos and earn money! [0 points required] Garbage Trucker , for this job, you are required to own a truck license and a vehicles driver license, [20 points required] Levels Levels, points or \"XP\" as it is called is a system to make the experience more challenging and competitive. You can gain levels by completing daily tasks and by doing tasks such as jobs and winning races. You also gain x amount of points each half hour playing on the server. You can also loose points by dying or getting jailed for example. So what can you do with levels? When you are starting out on the server you are pretty limited to what you can do. You can not purchase own vehicles from \"official\" stores which means you are forced to rent a vehicle or buy a custom vehicle from the auto-dealership or the business vehicle dealerships if you DO want a vehicle. Same goes for owning houses, the first \"househould\" you will be avaliable to own is a rented apartment where you can be safe. A lot of the jobs are locked to a lower or a higher level depending on the possible earnings you can receive from the job. Same goes for legal firearms that can be purchased of the Ammunation store. You can only purchase a firearm license after you reached x amount of points, Of course there is other ways to get a weapon, illegal firearms cough . By playing more on the server you earn more levels which will give you access to more interactions and give your character more status in the server community. \ud83d\udccc FOR SERVER OWNERS: This system can be disabled here as it still marked as a BETA feature. Money Money, the thing we all need. From the beginning you might not have as much money as some other people around. That is okay, Just be sure that you are handling your money in the correct way. Most important is as soon as possible buying a bank card from a bank anywhere in San Andreas in case you die or get robbed. Keeping all of your money in your pockets is a BIG no no. Keep a few dollars on your pocket cash for normal day to day business to be safe. To transfer, deposit or withdrawal from your bank card you can visit a bank or a ATM which is located around the map. To view the amount of pocket cash you have open your menu -> inventory -> cash -> use item . Licenses Oh, Licenses? Yes! You will need a license for certain things which are... Legal firearm Driver's license Trucking license Pilot license After completing and purchasing the license you can showcase it to an officer in your inventory menu by hitting use item on your license item. Your license can be revoked by a police officer or in worst case by a speed camera due to excessive speeding. Soo...

That's cool, Now let us help you install it to your awesome server! Server Setup You might need to tweak a few things to get the best results from the framework, Old artifact versions and such may cause the framework to perform bad in certain areas. Make sure that you have checked all of these before moving on with the guide. Make sure that your server is running on a updated version for either linux or windows . Make sure that you are using onesync legacy in the server.cfg . As we are using OneSync Legacy technology, The framework is heavily dependant on this. Required Resources To run our framework you will need a few things to make sure it will run as expected. Without these required dependencies certain functions may perform bad or not work at all. mysql-async (the most important resource by far, Communicates with your database) eup-stream (The clothing for certain jobs such as police require this. Recommended version is \"V.3 (Update 3.6)\" .) These resources should be started before any framework resources as they should be loaded prior to the framework. Server Configuration Lets configure the server.cfg file, Add the following lines to the config. It is important that you set the wosa.key with your license key in order for the framework to properly boot up. # Convars set wosa.key \"mykey\" # required set wosa.server \"my server!\" # not required set wosa.discord \"my discord\" # not required set wosa.website \"my website\" # not required set wosa.discord_server_log \"my webhook\" # not required set wosa.discord_report_log \"my webhook\" # not required # required ensure mysql-async ensure eup-stream ensure wosa_core ensure wosa_jobs ensure wosa_assets # This is required unless you change police & fire configs to your own vehicles. # recommended but not required ensure wosa_hud ensure wosa_chat Download Time to download all the required files to run the framework! Super easy, Just follow these steps! You can either download the latest version or the experimental (click to download) version from our GitHub. The experimental version might be unstable, broken or not working at all as it is the \"test\" version still under going heavy development. Import the import.sql file from the download and import it to your database, There are loads of tutorials on the internet if you are unsure how to do it. Add all of the wosa_ files to /resources , We strongly recommend you to create a sub folder within the /resources folder like this /resources/[wosa] to support our UpdateFFX tool for example.

It wont you connect? Whoops, Dont panic, We are here to help you! Issue: When I start the server it just freezes and/or restarts by itself all the time. Solution: This behavior indicates that the framework license key is not valid or already in use, Make sure that you got wosa.key set in the server.cfg or try to wait for about 1-5 minutes. A non-valid key will crash/freeze your server. Issue: The MySQL gives a ton of errors on startup. Solution: If you are receiving heavy MySQL errors on startup you have most likley failed to setup your database or the mysql-async properly. To make sure you have not missed anything consider following this guide regarding the setup of mysql-async. Issue: When I launch the server it says that the key is not valid. Solution: This error indicates that you have not entered or entered the wrong \"wosa.key\" in the \"server.cfg\", Make sure that you did follow the installation guide. Issue: When I start my server it says that my key is already in use. Solution: This means that the wosa.key you entered in your server.cfg is already marked as \"in use\" by our auth server. Only one server at time can use a specific key, If you require more for your community please contact support. If you did just close your server please wait up to 5 minutes for the auth service to re-sync. To avoid having to wait ~5 minutes you can use the command \"quit\" when closing the server or manually shut down the core with \"stop wosa_core\" before closing the terminal. Issue: The console says that MariaDB field xxx does not have a default value. Solution: This is hopefully fixed in newer versions of wosa and should not occur but if it do occur please read this post. Issue: Cars in the server wont spawn and will just spam the F8 console / When I try to spawn a car from the garage I just get a black screen.
